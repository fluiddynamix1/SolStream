# SolStream
Stream txs on Solana using lock &amp; stream directly into the next avail. block.
Imagine you're in a bustling city, and you need to send a package urgently. Instead of waiting in line at a busy post office..
You have a special service that directly places your package into the next available delivery vehicle, ensuring it reaches its destination quickly and safely. 
The goal of this app is that it does precisely that with TXs on Solana.
Solstream uses a 'lock and stream' mechanism 2 ensure  transactions don't just get processedâ€”they get streamed directly into the next available block per provided instructions.
