# SolStream
Stream txs on Solana using lock &amp; stream directly into the next avail. block.


**FRAMEWORK:**

State Management:
6.	Define state in Rust and serialize w. borsh. 
7.	 Arweave for permanent off-chain storage. 
8.	Implement probabilistic state changes to reflect the probabilistic nature of transaction inclusion.
9.	Utilize a state management library and plan for state migrations or versioning.

Shared Programs Integration:
10.	Mock success and failure scenarios for SPL calls.
11.	Implement exponential backoff retry logic for handling network or service failure.
12.	Cache SPL responses to improve performance and reduce network calls.
13.	Document integration points with shared programs (SPLs).

Access Control:
14.	Align permissions with blockchain principles of openness and transparency.
15.	Users authenticate and sign transactions using their Solana wallets.
16.	Use hierarchical deterministic wallets for managing user keys.
17.	Use Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for critical keys.
•	Regularly audit and rotate permissions and secrets.
•	Plan for key rotation, revocation, backup, and recovery.
18.	Maintain a manually curated blacklist of public keys within a TEE

Signature Verification:
19.	Use libsodium for signature verification.
20.	Implement error handling for invalid signatures.
21.	Use hardware wallets for ultra-secure key storage.

Transaction Processing:
22.	Implement throttling based on transaction type. Why ?
23.	Use caching, rate limiting, and queueing to manage load.
24.	Implement exponential backoff retries for transaction failures.
25.	Introduce telemetry with transaction lifecycle events for monitoring.
26.	USe asynchronous transaction processing to reduce waiting times.

Optimistic Confirmation:
27.	Cache sequencer responses to reduce network calls.
28.	Handle mismatches between estimated and actual inclusion gracefully.
29.	Handle transaction replacement edge cases.
30.	Collect confirmation time metrics for performance tuning.
31.	Implement user opt-in notifications via WebSocket for real-time updates.

Error Handling:
32.	Send telemetry for error aggregation and monitoring.
33.	Classify errors by severity to prioritize issue resolution.
34.	Implement request tracing for debugging.
35.	Prepare an incident response plan and post-mortem analysis.
36.	Implement user-friendly error messages and fallback strategies.
